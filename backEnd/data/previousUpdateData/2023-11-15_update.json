    "id": "BFjWKMvINdc",
    "summary": "The increasing integration of AI into the film-making and storytelling processes stirs up concerns among artists who fear their creativity may be replaced. Many artists worry about their works being used to train AI without their consent. Some studios aim to exploit artists' likenesses through machines, an issue currently causing unrest. Yet, AI also empowers creators to dream big and implement high-tier effects at a lower cost. Balance can be achieved if copyright law is adhered to, consent is sought, and new styles are developed instead of mimicking existing works. AI can revolutionise creativity if harnessed correctly."
